# Difference Between Relative and Absolute Positioning

Relative and Absolute positioning confuses me a lot. I have to make some notes and points to make myself clear on it.

## Relative Position

 - If you want to move an element on a page, use `position: relative;` on the element.
 - After setting relative positioning, you can use `top left right bottom` css properties.

## Absolute Position

 - Absolute position means, positioning an element to its nearest parent.
