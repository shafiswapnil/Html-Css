# Anchor Links

Notes -

- Use `target="_blank"` in your anchor tag, when it's needed. Because don't hold down your users to stay on your website. Don't be greedy.

- Don't use broken links.

- Remember, file named **index.extension** in a particular directory, is the default start page of the directory/website. So [https://www.facebook.com/index.php] is identical to [https://www.facebook.com/].
