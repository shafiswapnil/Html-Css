# First Stylesheet
*CSS - Cascading Style Sheet*

> Why we put link element and script element in the `head`?
Actually, the thing is, link element and script element won't print something on the screen. rather it would work behind the scene. That's why we put link and ecript element on the `head` section.


> **Follow best practises**
Always use external stylesheets.
Don't use internal style tags.
Use HTML for only markup purposes. Try not to add CSS in it. Be clean.

> And, please maintain clean project structure!
Put your `.css` files in it's own folder. ie, CSS/ folder for storing css files.
And yes, `.js` files in js/ folder. Images in img/ folder.
